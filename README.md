Simple API gateway + lambda + cloudformation + dynamodb

From https://cloudonaut.io/create-a-serverless-restful-api-with-api-gateway-swagger-lambda-and-dynamodb/


## Notes

(2017/05/03): For some reason the API Gateway is not always updated? Just delete the stack and redeploy.  Most of time everything should update properly.
